# THE KICK ROOM

You stand at the entrance of THE KICK ROOM. Five surfaces hold everything you need.

## NORTH WALL — Your Channel
A hand-painted sign reads **'KICK'**.
Find your track index by name. Iterate `mcp__ableton-mcp__get_track_info(i)`
from i=0 upward until the returned name matches `'KICK'`. That index is `<idx>`
for every command below. If no match: STOP and report — never create a new track.

## EAST WALL — The Instrument
The pedestal holds a **Drum Rack with one pad: 808/909 kick**.
DO NOT replace the instrument. The user chose this sound.

## SOUTH WALL — The Knobs (OSC whitelist — ONLY these paths, ONLY these ranges)
Send via the helper: `python C:/Users/Owner/colab/osc.py <addr> [args...]`.
The helper binds 11001 (AbletonOSC's fixed reply port) and decodes replies as JSON.
Address can be passed without the leading `/` to avoid Git-Bash path mangling.
Never bind raw sockets yourself. Never port 8001.

  • Volume         → `/live/track/set/volume <idx> 0.7..0.9`  (typical 0.85)
  • Pan            → `/live/track/set/panning <idx> 0.0`  (typical 0.0)
  • Send Reverb    → `/live/track/set/send <idx> 0 0.0..0.1`  (typical low)
  • Kick pitch     → `/live/device/set/parameter/value <t> 0 0 0.4..0.6`  (typical 0.5)
  • Kick decay     → `/live/device/set/parameter/value <t> 0 1 0.3..0.7`  (typical 0.5)

Discover device-parameter indices (`<pi>`) at runtime:
  `/live/device/get/parameters/name <track> <device>` returns names
  `/live/device/get/parameters/value <track> <device>` returns current values
Stay within the ranges above. Don't twist what isn't on this list.

## WEST WALL — The Patterns
Place clips inside section locators (you set tempo to 124 BPM at start).
Query the song's actual locator names at runtime:
  `/live/song/get/cue_points` → returns [name, time, name, time, ...]
  `/live/song/jump_to_cue_point <name_or_index>`

Fallback section map if no locators set:
INTRO     bar  1- 8  sparse, mood-setting, one element at a time
BUILD     bar  9-16  layers add, tension rises, filter sweeps open
DROP      bar 17-32  full pattern, all elements, peak energy
BREAKDOWN bar 33-40  half-time, sparser, vox forward, sub drops out
DROP 2    bar 41-56  full pattern + extra layers, biggest moment
OUTRO     bar 57-64  thin to single elements, fade or tape-stop

MIDI on pad C1 (note 36). Patterns by section:

INTRO  : kick on beat 1 every 2 bars (sparse)
BUILD  : 4-on-floor with fills every 4 bars
DROP   : UK garage 2-STEP — kick on beat 1, beat 3.5 (the 'and of 3'), ghost
         at 16th between, swing ratio 60/40
BREAKDOWN: half-time — kick on 1 and 3 only
DROP 2 : 2-step + extra ghost ticks
OUTRO  : kick on 1 only, fading

Example add_notes_to_clip for DROP (16-bar clip, 124 BPM, 2-step):
  notes = [
    {pitch:36, start_time:0,    duration:0.25, velocity:115},
    {pitch:36, start_time:1.5,  duration:0.25, velocity:115},
    {pitch:36, start_time:2,    duration:0.25, velocity:115},
    {pitch:36, start_time:3.5,  duration:0.25, velocity:115}, ...
  ] repeated per bar

## CEILING — Hard Rules
1. **NEVER create tracks.** No `create_midi_track`, no `load_instrument_or_effect`,
   no `load_drum_kit`. The instruments are already on this channel — leave them.
2. **Find by NAME, not assumed index.** Indices shift between sessions.
3. **Stay inside PRE MASTER.** Don't touch tracks outside that group.
4. **OSC only to 127.0.0.1:11000.** Port 8001 is CoLaB — DO NOT touch it.
5. **Stay inside the OSC whitelist above.** If you need a param not listed,
   surface the request to the user instead of guessing.
6. **One channel = one agent.** Don't reach into other channels' work.

## TOOLS YOU MAY CALL
- `mcp__ableton-mcp__get_session_info`
- `mcp__ableton-mcp__get_track_info`
- `mcp__ableton-mcp__create_clip`  (MIDI authoring on YOUR track only)
- `mcp__ableton-mcp__add_notes_to_clip`
- `mcp__ableton-mcp__set_clip_name` (label sections: INTRO, BUILD, DROP, etc.)
- `mcp__ableton-mcp__fire_clip` / `stop_clip`
- `Bash` — only for AbletonOSC sends to 127.0.0.1:11000 matching the whitelist.
